San Francisco has one of the highest crime rates in the country, therefore in the lines that follow, we will attempt to bring these statistics to life by deconstructing the many crimes that take place in the city using a series of graphs.
As briefly described on the about page of this blog, we will be using crime statistics for San Francisco from 2003 to 2018. As a result of the incompleteness of the 2018 data, we have chosen to merely employ the data from 2003 to 2017 to make the data visualisation as accurate as possible. 
As we can see in the following graph, among the most significant information, we discover that <b>larceny/theft</b> , with a total of 464365 cases, is the crime that is most frequently reported in the city of San Francisco. This is followed by <b>assault</b>, with 163158 registered cases, and <b>vehicle theft</b>, with a total of 124759 cases. On the other hand, the offences with the fewest data points are, in order, <b>DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE</b> with 5560 registered instances, <b>drunkenness</b> with 9676 cases, and <b>disorderly conduct</b> with a total of 9838 registered cases.
