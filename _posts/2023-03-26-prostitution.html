<p>Prostitution in San Francisco is a real problem and on a large scale as the data shows, over the years a total of 16453 cases of prostitution have been registered, as can be seen in the graph shown in Post 1: "Crime in SF in General Figures".</p>

<p>This problem affects in a broad sense the population of the city, being referred to in numerous articles such as <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2014/06/prostitution-on-capp-street-increasing-say-residents/">this one</a>.</p>

<p>The number of prostitution offences that occur during the day is depicted in the following polar bar chart in terms of hourly totals. There is a definite trend in the statistics, showing that prostitution grows as the hours pass and that morning offences are substantially less common than evening crimes. In terms of numbers, the hours with the <b>highest crime rates</b> are <b>22:00</b> and <b>23:00</b>, followed by 19:00 and 00:00. On the other side, <b>fewer crimes</b> are reported between the hours of <b>8:00</b> and <b>9:00,</b> followed by 10:00 and 11:00.</p>

<p>Additional research has revealed that prostitution-related offences are more common on Thursdays, when there is a noticeable rise in incidents. Prostitution cases have also witnessed considerable changes over time, with significant rises in years like 2011 and 2016.</p>
