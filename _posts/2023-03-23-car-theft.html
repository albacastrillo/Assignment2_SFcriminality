After looking on social media we found out that a lot of Inconsiderate drivers may abandon their cars in what appear to be secure locations only to find out later that they have been the victim of theft. Our database shows that there have been 464,365 instances of car theft in San Francisco. After reading this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/san-francisco-crime-policy/479880/ ">article</a> who confirmed our hypothesis we decided to carry out a careful study to learn more about this crime.</p>
