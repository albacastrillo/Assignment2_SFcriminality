<p>In San Francisco, car theft is a frequent offense that can happen at any time. After looking on social media, we found out that a lot of inconsiderate drivers may abandon their cars in what appear to be secure locations only to find out later that they have been the victim of theft. Our database shows that there have been 464,365 instances of car theft in San Francisco. After reading this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/san-francisco-crime-policy/479880/ ">article</a> which confirmed our hypothesis, we decided to carry out a careful study to learn more about this crime.</p>

<p>According to our research, <b>most car thefts</b> in San Francisco take place in the city's core, especially in the <b>Southern, Mission, and Northern districts</b>. The locations of these offenses between January and December are depicted in plots we developed.</p>

<p>Another fun analysis showed that if you are going to the city in a Sunday you shouldn’t park your car in the <b>Southern District</b>.</p>
