<p>San Francisco is one of the four most populous cities in California, ranking fourth overall. Large-scale issues with public health and safety are brought on by crime in this town. The city is plagued by a variety of crimes, from theft to vandalism, as we shall discover when we go through all the postings in this blog.

<p>Through the use of the data set including public safety statistics for San Francisco from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2018, we will attempt to bring the city's crime statistics to life in this blog. This will be accomplished by visualizing several plots that we will join through a story: “Robbery and larceny: a day in the life of San Francisco”
